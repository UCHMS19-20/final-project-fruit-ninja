# Fruit Ninja


## Description

This game is a different version of the popular mobile phone game. The main idea is the same but instead of swiping, the user moves a sword at the bottom of the screen using the left and right arrow keys. There are two types of objects that fall at varying speeds from the top of the screen, strawberries and bombs, and user must try to cut the strawberries without cutting the bombs.
